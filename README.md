##Content

Thank you for checking out my portfolio! You can read a little bit about me in the home page and check out some of what I have been doing in the projects sections. Some of the projects I have included are individual projects that I made. These may change as I continue to iterate and improve every single one of them as much as I can. Some of the other projects were group projects that I made during my UCB Coding Boot Camp. I got to work with some really smart and talented people making these projects. You can contact me below and there is also a section in the portfolio to leave a message if you wish to contact me there. My resume section lists some of the skills that I have learned and also a link to my resume where you can view and download it. Thank you again for viewing my portfolio and I look forward to getting in touch with you!

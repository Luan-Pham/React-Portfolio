            My name is Luan Pham and I am an aspiring web developer. I graduated
            from UC Davis in 2016 with a degree in Exercise Biology. Afterwards,
            I studied physical therapy and have been working in the field ever
            since. I have always been interested in programming and want to
            change to a career that will help my professional and personal
            growth. I decided to attend the UC Berkeley Coding Camp which helped
            me learn valuable web development skills. I am interested in video
            games, sports, film, and deep diving into the lore of fictional
            worlds.
